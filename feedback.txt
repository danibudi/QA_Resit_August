TODO:
- missing assertions - by definition they prove or deny the test results
- only one test case - required at least 3 with edge cases
- not used testing library - expected: unittest, pytest, etc.
- use exceptions. 
- Jenkins job doesn't run the test: missing Jenkins bat file. CI/CD will doesn't execute and show the test status
- use settings for the constants /urls/ to follow DNRY
- remove project files from git - only selenium related code should be in the repository + webdriver
- use SW metrics to improve the qualty of the code

-----------
- present penetration test
